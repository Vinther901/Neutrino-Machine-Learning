#Model1: First try
#Model2: First selfmade, now used for .energy prediction     acc: 0.0443 (?), 2_test_acc: 2.85, AUC: 0.948428 (class pred)
#Model3: Model2 readjusted for classifying types
#Model4: Improving Model3, perhaps total do over.           AUC: 0.9164886 (class pred)
#Model5: First attempt at DNAConv for type prediction       
#Model6: Model5 but for energy prediction                   test_acc: -1.11 (pred - true)
#Model7: DNAConv for class prediction                       AUC: 0.916741
