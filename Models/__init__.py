#Model1: First try
#Model2: First selfmade, now used for energy prediction     acc: 0.0443 (?)
#Model3: Model2 readjusted for classifying types
#Model4: Improving Model3, perhaps total do over.
#Model5: First attempt at DNAConv for type prediction       acc: 1 (when used for neutrino/muon prediction)
#Model6: Model5 but for energy prediction                   acc: 0.0443
